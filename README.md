Learn Python the Hard Way exercises

# comments
some exercises are missing due to them being orientated around setup, memorizing and written tasks

i did not complete the tasks that use flask as i prefer using react.js/next.js to build front end applications

working my way through the book has been an invaluable experience that has taught me much about the fundamentals of python and the use of git/github
